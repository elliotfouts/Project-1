Local Eats was founded in 2020 by four UCLA Extension bootcamp students to help people find local restaurants. In addition to finding new restaurants, you can use Local Eats to find everything you need to know about the restaurant including the caliber, average cost for two, phone number, and more! You can also find suggested nearby restaurants.
